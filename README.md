## Overview

This project is a simple game developed using the SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library. SDL2 was chosen for its cross-platform capabilities, built-in renderer, and comprehensive tools for game development, such as SDL_Rect for rectangles, SDL_TTF for font loading, and SDL_Mixer for sound loading. The project follows a structured approach, utilizing a GameEntity class as the base for game objects, and then deriving specific classes for the ball and paddles.

## Structure

### GameEntity Class

The `GameEntity` class contains methods related to SDL_Rect, serving as a foundational class for other game objects.

### Ball and Paddle Classes

Derived from the `GameEntity` class, these classes include additional methods specific to the ball and paddles, such as setting and getting speed.

## Gameplay Logic

The main logic of the game revolves around determining ball and paddle movements, as well as handling collisions. Movement is determined by x and y direction variables for the objects (-1, 0, 1). Collisions are detected with paddles, the top/bottom of the game window, and the left/right sides of the screen. Scoring occurs when the ball collides with the left/right sides, and the ball resets to the middle of the screen.

## AI Implementation

The computer-controlled paddle follows a simple AI function. If the ball is above the computerâ€™s paddle, it moves up, and if it's below, it moves down. This logic is implemented in the same way as player input, with a setY function and direction calculation.

## Sound Effects

Various sound effects enhance the gaming experience, triggered by different events such as scoring points, collisions with paddles, top/bottom of the screen, winning, and losing.

## Build System

CMake is used as the build system, providing a cross-platform solution. Troubleshooting was required, including the installation of custom CMake modules to address issues with finding SDL libraries. This approach eliminated the need for hardcoded paths in Makefiles, offering a more standardized build process.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure SDL2 is installed on your system.
3. Use CMake to generate build files.
4. Build the project.
5. Run the executable.
